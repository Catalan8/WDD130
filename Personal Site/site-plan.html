Our Mission
I created Scrubby Dubby Sugar Scrubs for those like me who suffer from  embarressing, flaky skin. After moving from sunny California to dry and frigid Idaho I experienced parched hands. Luckily, I found the solution in sugar scrubs. 
 
Now I share the gift of radiant skin with others. Because when you look good, smell good, and feel good you can accomplish great things! 
 
With Love, 
Heather
