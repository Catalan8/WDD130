    <p>I'm Heather and this is my <i>9th</i> semester at BYU-I. Next semester I will graduate with a degree in Marketing with an emphasis in Digital Marketing. I am planning on working for an agency running Google Ads after I graduate. I am planning on having midlife crisis and changing careers and one of thoose potential careers is a UX designer. If I don't make the switch to that career then I'll at least be able to create custom sections with a drag and drop edior after taking this class.I have already built 4 websites using Wordpress.I am taking this class becuase I love building websites but <b>cannot </b> remember coding after <i>multiple</i> attempts to teach myself. I have an obession with Germany and love to talk about it. I also speak French but don't like it a lot. I love swimming and go to the school's fitness classes a lot. I'm excited for this class because the professor has already taught in a way that clicks with me and will help me remember the material well.</p>
